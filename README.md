# Matrix MIDI Navigation of Ableton Live's Session View
Navigates ableton's session view as a 2D array with only two buttons (for X and Y) on my MIDI-controller. Assosiates different synths (MIDI tracks) with different scenes for fast navigation. Uses a combo of dictionaries and iterators. 

Also includes a script for doing MIDI-mapping between the controller and ableton.
