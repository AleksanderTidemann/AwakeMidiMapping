# Matrix MIDI Navigation
Navigates ableton's session view as a 2D array with only two buttons (for X and Y) on my MIDI-controller. The real benefit is that it assosiates every MIDI track with a designated a scene, ensuring fast navigation. Perfect for live use. Also includes a script for doing MIDI-mapping between the controller and ableton.
