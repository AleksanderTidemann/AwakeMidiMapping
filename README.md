# MIDI Navigation of Ableton Session View
Built for navigating ableton's session view as a 2D array using only two buttons (for X and Y) on my MIDI-controller. Also, assosiates different synths (MIDI tracks) with different scenes (in a dict) for even faster navigation.

## Requirements
```pip install ``` I will update this
